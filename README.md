For a better experience, every player in your lobby should download BetterPolus. You *can* play with people that don't have the mod installed but keep in mind that they won't see the same things as you (for example Vitals location).

### Custom install
1. Download the latest build of BepInEx Bleeding Edge **[on this page](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be)** (select BepInEx Unity IL2CPP for Windows x86 machines).
2. Unzip the file in your Among Us directory and run the game once. Close the game once you see the title screen.
3. Download the **dll file** for your game version in the **[Releases section](#releases)** below.
4. Copy the dll file into **`Among Us/BepInEx/plugins`**.
5. Run the game. The mod should be installed and it should work.
